						<t>The band's frontman, Brady is from Providence, RI. He was recruited in the fall of 2013 when the founding members decided they wanted to make a serious go of the band. To play for more than a couple dozen drunk college kids in a dorm, the band needed a real singer. Enter Brady Conley. Brady comes from a blues background, also fronting the Providence-based band Black and Bruised.

						Hailing from the far away land of Long Island, Mike is the only non-Irish and only Yankee fan in the band - though you wouldn't know it when he dons his alter ego (Mick O'Perillo) and sings Sweet Caroline. Mike has been playing guitar since he was a wee lad and is the rhythmic backbone and constant source of energy for the band.

						Drink of choice: Black Velvet (Magner's with a head of Guinness)
